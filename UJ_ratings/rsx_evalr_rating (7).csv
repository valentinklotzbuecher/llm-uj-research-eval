The animal welfare cost of meat: evidence from a survey of hypothetical scenarios among Belgian consumers,claims,"published, decent journal ",Markets for products with large externalities (focus: animal agriculture),Romain Espinosa,false,,,,,,,"This paper significantly contributes to the discussion on animal welfare valuation by showing some limits of anthropocentric valuation including his own approach. The author recognizes that his method is not reliable to obtain accurate estimates of the welfare of animals. However, it makes a great contribution by underlining the numerous issues that make such approaches unreliable  (e.g., the perception of the animal’s capacity to experience the world, the perception of the animal’s farming conditions, hypothetical biases, outliers, and exclusion criteria). The work also contains numerous limitations, and most of them are recognized by the author himself. The main (and most standard) limitation is the hypothetical nature of the survey: participants do not face real incentives, which might lead to underestimating or overestimating the welfare burden of our diet imposed on animals. One of the most intrinsic limits concerns the difficulty for lay people (and humans in general) to project themselves into the lives of animals of other species. One can be indeed ignorant about the needs, the perception of the world, the cognition, etc. of other species, such that estimating their welfare is a daunting task. In addition, humans can also be ignorant about the rearing conditions in “conventional” farms, making the estimates even more uncertain. Ultimately, the layers of complexity (unusual survey, ignorance about other species, uncertainty about rearing conditions) add up and make the point estimates hard to rely on",,"Animal Welfare (markets, attitudes)",Journal of Environmental Economics & Policy,2025-02-04,2/21/2025 1:40:45 PM

From a theoretical perspective, the measure of the human’s perception of the welfare of the animal is well defined: it corresponds to the change in private endowment that makes the human indifferent between living and not living the animal’s life on top of his own life. From an empirical perspective, the author estimates it by considering several challenges, including (i) that some participants might have positive or negative perceptions of the welfare of the animal (i.e., the author uses a first-stage question to elicit the preferred pill), (ii) WTA/WTP framing might alter the results, (iii) outliers could lead to extremely high average WTP/WTA, (iv) some participants might have very low confidence in this unusual exercise, and (v) there might be some intrinsic (dis)utility in living an animal’s life.",,"Animal Welfare (markets, attitudes)",Journal of Environmental Economics & Policy,2025-02-04,2/21/2025 1:40:45 PM
