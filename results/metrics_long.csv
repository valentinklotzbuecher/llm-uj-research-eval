2312.14289v2,overall,71,55,85,"Solid, well-argued report with thoughtful modeling and extensive sensitivity checks; limitations stem from speculative inputs and modest empirical validation. Overall quality rates comfortably above the median but not at the top tier."
2312.14289v2,claims_evidence,65,45,80,"Main claims are clearly stated and evidence marshalled transparently. However, evidence is largely indirect (expert elicitations, historical macro correlations) and speculative, lowering credibility relative to more data-rich studies."
2312.14289v2,methods,70,50,85,"Uses standard welfare-economic growth modeling, Monte-Carlo style sensitivity, integration of extinction risk. Assumptions are discussed and alternative parameterisations explored, yet empirical grounding and formal uncertainty propagation remain limited."
2312.14289v2,advancing_knowledge,75,55,90,"Combines disparate literatures (metascience, bio-risk, longtermism) into a single quantitative framework; few prior papers offer this synthesis. Opens new lines for cost-benefit of science under risk, valuable to funders."
2312.14289v2,logic_communication,80,60,90,"Argument flow is clear, sections well sign-posted, assumptions explicit, math and intuition explained. Some length and technical density may hinder accessibility but internal logic is strong."
2312.14289v2,open_science,50,30,70,"Report cites data sources and mentions Python code, yet full code and datasets are not public at time of review; replication would be possible but not turnkey."
2312.14289v2,global_relevance,85,65,95,Addresses existential bio-risk and social ROI of science—issues central to global priorities and philanthropy. Provides quantitative guidance for policy and funding decisions directly relevant to long-term welfare.
ssrn-4071953,overall,82,70,90,"Strong methods, clear communication, high policy relevance; open-science practices slightly weaker, but overall quality clearly top quintile."
ssrn-4071953,claims_evidence,85,70,93,"Main claims explicit; evidence from 18 RCTs, multiple robustness checks, publication-bias tests; some unavoidable residual uncertainty and reliance on author-provided data."
ssrn-4071953,methods,80,65,90,"Systematic search, appropriate random-effects meta, Bayesian & frequentist, sensitivity, cost-effectiveness modelling; minor concerns on heterogeneity modelling and age-specific risk."
ssrn-4071953,advancing_knowledge,80,65,90,First rigorous mortality-focused synthesis for water treatment; fills evidence gap and guides funding; not entirely novel statistically but big applied contribution.
ssrn-4071953,logic_communication,85,75,93,Structure and argumentation are clear; assumptions stated; visuals/tables aid comprehension; dense but generally readable.
ssrn-4071953,open_science,60,40,75,Search protocol preregistered; supplementary materials extensive; code availability implied but not fully public yet; relies on non-public author data.
ssrn-4071953,global_relevance,90,80,97,"Addresses major LMIC health burden, yields actionable cost-effectiveness results for donors/governments; aligns with SDG6 and child mortality priorities."
w23928,overall,69,55,80,"Agenda-setting theory piece linking AI, automation and growth; conceptual clarity and influence offset by limited empirical validation and modest open-science practice."
w23928,claims_evidence,65,50,80,"Main claims clearly stated and internally supported by stylised models and illustrative data, but evidence is mostly suggestive, not causal; robustness checks and alternative specifications are limited."
w23928,methods,70,55,85,"Applies standard growth-theory frameworks (Zeira, Baumol, Schumpeterian) appropriately; assumptions reasonable and well explained, but models remain partial-equilibrium, parameters not estimated, and no preregistration or multiple-test discipline."
w23928,advancing_knowledge,80,65,90,"Integrates AI into modern growth theory, opens new research avenues and is already widely cited; contributions are mainly conceptual but have influenced subsequent empirical and policy work."
w23928,logic_communication,85,70,95,"Arguments are transparent, step-by-step, with clear figures; key assumptions and caveats are spelt out; minor speculation sections are labelled as such."
w23928,open_science,40,20,60,No code or data repository; figures built from public datasets but not reproducible; no preregistration; working-paper availability and extensive referencing are positives.
w23928,global_relevance,75,60,90,"Addresses AI’s impact on growth, inequality and policy—issues central to global priorities; offers insights usable by policymakers, though quantitative policy guidance is limited."
w30539,overall,82,70,92,"Large, well-implemented nationwide RCT with clear, policy-relevant findings. Evidence and methods are very strong; communication good; open-science practices weaker. Averaged score ≈81, rounded up because methods and knowledge contributions are especially decision-relevant."
w30539,claims_evidence,85,70,95,Main claims are precise and directly addressed. Random assignment and large sample yield credible causal estimates; multiple robustness and mechanism checks. Some residual uncertainty from short time horizon and reliance on algorithmic violation detection.
w30539,methods,90,80,98,"Nation-wide cluster-RCT with cross-randomised intensity, appropriate DiD/IV estimation, clustered SEs, heterogeneity & spillover analyses. Design well justified; assumptions reasonable; threats to validity (measurement error, manipulation) directly tested. Few papers match this scale and rigor."
w30539,advancing_knowledge,88,75,95,First experimental evidence on large-scale citizen participation effects on environmental enforcement; informs political economy of regulation and social media accountability. Likely to guide future research and interventions beyond China.
w30539,logic_communication,80,65,90,"Paper is lengthy but arguments, hypotheses and results are transparent and logically organised; tables/figures clear. Some redundancy and technical density may hinder non-specialist readers."
w30539,open_science,60,40,80,"RCT pre-registered; data appendix provided. However, raw CEMS and administrative data not publicly shareable; replication code availability unclear. Limited open materials lower score relative to recent best practices."
w30539,global_relevance,85,70,95,"Addresses air & water pollution—global health priorities—and offers scalable, low-cost governance tool. Findings relevant to many LMIC contexts with weak enforcement. Direct policy implications for large emitter (China) amplify relevance."
w33018,overall,80,70,88,"High-quality dual RCT design, solid causal estimates, strong policy relevance; minor concerns on generalisability and open-data temper score."
w33018,claims_evidence,80,70,90,Main questions well stated; evidence from large online and field RCTs convincingly supports claims; effect sizes and uncertainty reported; some residual risk of unobserved spillovers.
w33018,methods,85,70,95,"Randomised assignment, preregistration, IV for compliance, robustness and heterogeneity analysis; small covariate imbalance handled; methods state-of-the-art for political-economy fieldwork."
w33018,advancing_knowledge,75,60,85,Adds rare causal evidence that correcting misperceptions can shift votes under authoritarianism; complements literature yet context-specific (Türkiye) limits breadth.
w33018,logic_communication,85,75,95,"Clear narrative, transparent assumptions, detailed appendices, effective visuals; long manuscript but argument easy to follow."
w33018,open_science,70,50,85,"Pre-registered on AEA, instruments and code availability mentioned; data sharing constrained (administrative voting data, privacy); replication package not yet public."
w33018,global_relevance,80,65,90,Addresses erosion of democracy—a top global priority; findings useful for practitioners designing pro-democracy information campaigns.
