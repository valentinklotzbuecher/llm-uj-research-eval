2312.14289v2,overall,73,60,85,"Integrates solid modelling, careful sensitivity analysis, and a highly pertinent question. Limits come from heavy reliance on speculative forecasts and modest methodological novelty. Overall quality roughly three-quarters up the distribution of recent meta-science / GCR economics work."
2312.14289v2,claims_evidence,70,55,80,"Research questions are explicit; claims are linked to quantitative outputs; uncertainty is candidly discussed. Evidence base is partly thin (expert-elicited probabilities, historical macro correlations) so strength is moderate, not top-tier."
2312.14289v2,methods,65,50,78,"Simple but sensible welfare-economic model, multiple scenario and parameter sweeps, some robustness checks. Assumptions bold and often unverifiable; no formal Bayesian model comparison or structural estimation. Solid but not exceptional."
2312.14289v2,advancing_knowledge,80,65,90,"Few prior attempts give a unified ROI to science incorporating extinction risk. This report fills a live decision gap for funders of science & bio-risk mitigation, so contribution is large even if conclusions are provisional."
2312.14289v2,logic_communication,75,60,85,"Report is logically laid out, assumptions and derivations explained, tables/figures generally match narrative. Length and density hinder casual readers and some algebra relegated to code, but overall clarity exceeds field median."
2312.14289v2,open_science,60,40,75,"Provides parameter tables, cites data sources, and mentions publicly available Python code, but repository and full datasets are not yet fully documented or archived; no pre-registration. Replicability above average but not exemplary."
2312.14289v2,global_relevance,85,70,95,Addresses allocation of billions in science funding and existential bio-risk—core global-priority themes. Results expressed in ROI terms that policymakers can digest. Practical implications for grant-makers and regulators are explicit.
w23928,overall,73,60,85,"Strong conceptual contribution and clear exposition give above-average quality, but evidence and open-science practices are middling; weighted average of category scores seems appropriate."
w23928,claims_evidence,60,45,70,"Main claims are framed as speculative questions; theoretical derivations are sound but empirical support is illustrative only. Adequate honesty about limitations, yet evidential strength is moderate."
w23928,methods,70,55,80,"Uses established growth-theory modelling, extends Zeira/Baumol frameworks creatively. Assumptions discussed but not fully stress-tested; proofs/sketches sufficient for a WP. Rigour better than median but not frontier formalism."
w23928,advancing_knowledge,80,65,90,"Defines agenda linking AI and long-run growth, now highly cited. Offers new synthesis (automation + Baumol) and highlights research gaps, shaping subsequent literature—clear field contribution."
w23928,logic_communication,85,75,95,"Questions, assumptions, and derivations are laid out transparently; writing is engaging and well-structured. Minor complexity overload but reasoning is generally easy to follow."
w23928,open_science,60,40,70,"Working paper freely accessible; data sources cited. No code, replication package or preregistration (mostly theory). Moderate openness by econ standards."
w23928,global_relevance,85,70,95,"Addresses AI’s impact on growth, income distribution, and policy—topics of wide global importance. Insights applicable to both advanced and emerging economies; high practitioner salience."
w30539,overall,88,80,95,"Large-scale, well-designed nationwide RCT with clever cross-randomization delivers credible, policy-relevant evidence; writing is clear; limitations mainly around open-science practices. Mean of component mid-points ≈88 so default retained."
w30539,claims_evidence,90,83,96,"Core questions are explicit; causal claims supported by randomization, rich administrative data, multiple robustness checks and heterogeneity analyses; effect magnitudes sensibly interpreted. Some residual uncertainty about long-run external validity and causal channels."
w30539,methods,92,85,97,"Nationwide firm-level RCT, double randomization for GE effects, pre-registration, thoughtful measurement verification, clustered SEs and many robustness checks. Minor concerns: short horizon, unverifiable self-reported NGO actions."
w30539,advancing_knowledge,88,78,95,First large-scale causal evidence on citizen complaints’ effects on environmental enforcement and GE spillovers in an authoritarian context; informs political economy of regulation and social media literatures; likely to spur follow-up work.
w30539,logic_communication,90,82,95,"Paper is well structured, arguments transparent, concepts defined, tables/figures clear; alternative mechanisms discussed systematically. Lengthy but readable; small redundancies."
w30539,open_science,70,55,85,RCT registered; data appendix available; many administrative data are proprietary and code not (yet) fully public; limited shared replication package. Hence above average but not top-tier.
w30539,global_relevance,95,88,99,Targets China—the largest polluter—and addresses enforceability of regulations; insights generalisable to other LMICs and high-stakes for global air quality and climate policy; clear implications for practitioners and policymakers.
w33018,overall,86,78,93,"Large-scale online and field RCTs, preregistered, solid causal inference and clear writing by senior scholars; minor uncertainty from open-science transparency and external validity."
w33018,claims_evidence,85,75,92,"Research questions explicit; evidence aligns well with claims; placebo and robustness bolster credibility, though some interpretation hinges on V-DEM as ground truth."
w33018,methods,90,82,96,"Well-powered RCT design, IV estimation, pre-analysis plan, balance checks, multiple robustness tests—state-of-the-art for political-economy field work."
w33018,advancing_knowledge,85,70,92,Provides rare causal evidence on misperceptions and democratic support under authoritarianism; likely to influence both academic and policy agendas.
w33018,logic_communication,88,80,95,"Argument flows logically, assumptions explicit, figures and tables clear; paper long but navigable."
w33018,open_science,70,55,85,"AEA registry, IRB approvals and promised data/code release; yet data not public at working-paper stage and some partnering constraints limit full reproducibility."
w33018,global_relevance,90,80,97,Addresses erosion of democracy—a top global priority; findings informative for practitioners designing pro-democracy interventions worldwide.
