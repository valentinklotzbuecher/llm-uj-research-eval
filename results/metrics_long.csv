Epperson and Gerster 2024,open_science,70,55,85,"Pre-registered, IRB approved, key materials (code, questionnaires) promised; field data proprietary so replication partial. Overall above average openness."

Fangwa et al. 2023,overall,70,60,80,"Solid RCT-based evidence, clearly written, good methods and high policy salience; moderate novelty and limited data/code transparency pull overall down a bit."
Fangwa et al. 2023,claims_evidence,70,60,80,"Claims are specific; evidence from randomized rollout, event-study and robustness checks supports them. Some causal channels remain speculative and un-bundling not possible."
Fangwa et al. 2023,methods,75,65,85,"Well-powered cluster RCT with pre-analysis diff-in-diff, event studies, heterogeneity and robustness. Some reliance on admin data quality and matched observational comparisons for secondary questions."

Haushofer et al. 2020,overall,77,65,88,"Large, well-powered RCT with pre-registration, low attrition, clear writing and useful policy insights. Methods and evidence are first-rate; openness and novelty are good but not field-leading. Averaging component scores gives ~77, which seems appropriate; no single dimension warrants overriding this mean."
Haushofer et al. 2020,claims_evidence,80,70,90,Claims are stated precisely; causal identification is strong; measures and statistical adjustments are appropriate. Effect sizes and limits are discussed candidly. Minor caveats on external validity and interpretation of nulls prevent a top-decile score.
Haushofer et al. 2020,methods,85,75,95,"Cluster-randomised design, ANCOVA, FDR control, pre-analysis plan, power analysis, demand check, heterogeneous‐effects and spillover analysis. Implementation fidelity monitored. Few papers deploy such comprehensive design, hence high percentile."
Haushofer et al. 2020,advancing_knowledge,70,55,85,"Direct comparison of cash and psychotherapy in LMIC mental-health space is novel and relevant; results challenge assumptions about low-dose therapy. Still, complements existing cash-transfer literature rather than opening an entirely new area."
Haushofer et al. 2020,logic_communication,80,70,90,"Goals, assumptions and analytic steps are spelled out; figures and tables clear; reasoning transparent. Length and detail occasionally hinder readability, preventing very top score."
Haushofer et al. 2020,open_science,65,50,80,Study pre-registered; appendices and instruments online. Data/code availability not fully public at time of working paper; PM+ manual proprietary. Replication possible but with some effort.

Jack et al. 2022,claims_evidence,80,70,90,"Main claims are clearly stated and backed by multiple outcome sources (contract data, ML-based imagery, survey). Evidence is internally valid; characterization of uncertainty and limitations is honest, though discussion of measurement error and spillovers could be deeper."
Jack et al. 2022,methods,85,75,95,"Cluster-RCT with pre-analysis plan, robust randomisation, multiple outcome measures, and credible ML classification. Statistical analysis appropriate; sensitivity checks shown. Remaining concerns: reliance on treatment-only negative labels and modest power for heterogeneity."

Kremer et al. 2020,overall,64,50,75,"Solid, well-argued review article with high policy salience but modest original evidence and limited openness. Roughly two-thirds of recent work in development econ/policy is weaker, but many full empirical studies outshine it."
Kremer et al. 2020,claims_evidence,60,45,70,"Main claims (AMC logic, cost-effectiveness, design lessons) are clearly articulated and backed by cited descriptive statistics and theoretical references, yet rely on rough comparisons and lack a formal counterfactual, so evidentiary strength is moderate."
Kremer et al. 2020,methods,55,40,65,"Combines simple economic theory, back-of-the-envelope welfare calculations, and qualitative comparison with rotavirus rollout. Reasonable for a P&P note but far from state-of-the-art causal inference or structural modelling."
Kremer et al. 2020,advancing_knowledge,65,50,75,"Synthesises a decade of AMC experience, distils design issues, and frames future research directions; incremental but valuable for practitioners and researchers in vaccine finance and pull incentives."

Kubo et al. 2023,claims_evidence,70,50,85,"Central claim (trade bans create spillover demand) is clearly stated and supported by consistent SDID estimates and robustness checks, yet evidence is drawn from one platform/country and relies on imperfect substitutability assumptions."

Liang et al. 2021,overall,78,65,88,"Strong causal design, novel dataset, and policy‐relevant insights place the paper above most recent work.
