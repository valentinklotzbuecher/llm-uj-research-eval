w30539,overall,86,78,92,"Large-scale nationwide RCT, original in scope, rigorous methods, persuasive evidence, clear writing, and high policy relevance. Slightly limited by data/code accessibility and by the fact that it is still a working paper. Mean of component scores fits well; no dominant single dimension warrants deviation."
w30539,claims_evidence,87,75,94,"Research questions and hypotheses are explicit; causal claims are appropriately bounded. Multiple robustness checks, heterogeneous effects, falsification tests, and GE analysis strengthen evidential base. Minor concern: some mechanisms remain inferential rather than directly tested."
w30539,methods,92,80,97,"Nationwide randomization, cross-randomized saturation design, pre-specified outcomes, credible identification, clustering, balance/power checks, and thoughtful heterogeneity analyses. Few recent studies match this scale and rigor. Remaining uncertainty: reliance on government-provided data and scope for undisclosed specification searches."
w30539,advancing_knowledge,84,70,92,"Provides rare experimental evidence on citizen participation effects, social media, and environmental governance in an authoritarian setting, informing both political economy and environmental regulation literatures. Contribution is notable but incremental relative to broader governance and pollution control research agenda."
w30539,logic_communication,88,75,95,"Paper is well-structured, concepts defined, arguments logically developed, figures and tables clear. Discussion of limitations and mechanisms is transparent. Length and density may challenge non-specialists, but reasoning remains traceable."
w30539,open_science,75,55,85,"AEARCT registration, online appendix, and promise of data appendix are positives. Raw CEMS data and 12369 complaints are proprietary; replication code not yet public. Hence above average but not exemplary openness."
w30539,global_relevance,90,80,97,"Targets air and water pollution—major global health threats—using scalable, low-cost civic tools. Results bear directly on SDG priorities, environmental governance in emerging economies, and digital accountability, making the findings highly salient to policymakers and practitioners worldwide."
w33018,overall,83,70,92,"Large, well-designed online and 880k-voter field RCT; careful analysis and plausible claims. Some external-validity limits (single province, short time horizon) and incomplete openness keep it shy of top decile."
w33018,claims_evidence,80,65,90,Main claims (misperceptions exist; info shifts beliefs/votes) are clearly stated and mostly supported. Evidence strong but relies on one region and self-reports for some outcomes; spillovers and demand effects partly addressed.
w33018,methods,85,70,93,"Randomized assignment, large sample, pre-registration, multiple robustness checks. Minor baseline imbalances, clustered inference, and limited measurement of untreated spillovers slightly reduce certainty."
w33018,advancing_knowledge,90,75,97,First large-scale causal evidence that correcting institutional misperceptions can erode authoritarian support. Adds to political-economy and democracy literatures; high policy salience.
w33018,logic_communication,90,75,97,"Questions, theory and steps are explicit; writing is clear; figures and tables well integrated; limitations acknowledged."
w33018,open_science,70,50,85,"Pre-registered; IRB approvals noted. Code, instruments and data availability promised but not yet public in working-paper stage; some constraints on voter data sharing."
w33018,global_relevance,85,70,95,"Addresses democracy erosion—a top global priority—using scalable interventions. Insights applicable to other authoritarian contexts, though cultural specificity tempers universality."
