Aghion et al. 2017,overall,69,60,78,"Approximate mean of category scores. The paper is a well-respected conceptual/theoretical contribution with strong exposition and relevance, but limited empirical evidence and modest openness, pulling the mean below the top quartile."
Aghion et al. 2017,claims_evidence,65,55,75,"Main questions clearly posed and caveats discussed, but evidence is almost entirely theoretical or illustrative simulations. No empirical validation or formal proofs; some assertions remain speculative, so strength of evidence is moderate."
Aghion et al. 2017,methods,72,60,82,"Uses established endogenous-growth frameworks (Zeira, Acemoglu-Restrepo) and extends them thoughtfully. Assumptions are stated and comparative-static logic is sound. However, many results are heuristic, some knife-edge, and robustness checks are qualitative, not formal, so credibility is good but not exceptional."
Aghion et al. 2017,advancing_knowledge,80,70,90,"Defines a clear research agenda linking AI, automation and growth; introduces Baumol-Zeira synthesis, highlights singularity conditions, and frames firm-level issues. Widely cited and has already stimulated follow-up work, so contribution is high."
Aghion et al. 2017,logic_communication,85,75,93,"Writing is clear, logically structured, and accessible; key assumptions and steps are transparent, figures aid intuition, and limitations are acknowledged. Minor algebra is omitted, but arguments remain easy to follow for specialists."
Aghion et al. 2017,open_science,40,25,60,"Working paper is freely available, but no replication files, code, or data are provided; models are verbal/mathematical only. No preregistration or version control. Openness therefore below median for the field."
Aghion et al. 2017,global_relevance,70,60,80,"Addresses AI’s impact on growth, inequality, and structural change—issues central to global policy debates. Policymakers can glean qualitative insights, but quantitative guidance is limited, and developing-country considerations are brief, so relevance is good but not top-tier."

Alcott et al. 2024,claims_evidence,80,70,90,"Core claims (variance of distortions matters; average effects can mislead) are clearly stated and logically tied to theory. Experiments and ancillary data back them convincingly, though limited external validity and potential demand effects reduce certainty."
Alcott et al. 2024,methods,77,68,86,"Public-finance sufficient-statistic derivations are rigorous; mixed-effects estimation of covariances is appropriate.

Arora et al. 2023,global_relevance,60,45,70,Findings most directly inform US science & innovation policy; lessons generalisable to other high-income contexts but less to LMICs or global priorities like climate mitigation. Practical relevance moderate.
Bahar et al. 2022,overall,68,55,80,"Average of category scores ≈68. No single dimension overwhelmingly dominates policy usefulness, so mean is appropriate."

Epperson and Gerster 2024,open_science,85,70,95,"Pre-registration, IRB approval, publicly posted PAP, detailed appendices, description of data sources and code availability promised. Subject to minor caveat that canteen data cannot be fully public for privacy."
Epperson and Gerster 2024,global_relevance,60,40,75,"Animal welfare, climate and dietary change are important global issues, yet study is confined to German students with pork-specific VR stimulus; policy takeaways need replication in diverse populations and other domains."
Fangwa et al. 2023,overall,75,65,85,"Strong causal design, clear results, and high relevance yield a solid paper, though open-science shortfalls and limits to external validity temper the score."
Fangwa et al. 2023,claims_evidence,78,65,90,Main questions and claims are explicit; evidence from a large-scale randomized rollout supports them and alternative explanations are probed. Some residual uncertainty on causal mechanism attribution and measurement error keeps it below the very top.
Fangwa et al. 2023,methods,80,68,90,"Randomized assignment, event-study, robust checks, contamination tests and matching are well executed. Lack of pre-registration, limited power for some outcomes, and bundled treatment (cannot unpack components) slightly reduce confidence."
Fangwa et al. 2023,advancing_knowledge,75,60,88,Addresses a rare but important governance issue in low-income health systems and offers policy-relevant evidence; contribution is substantial though bounded to one sector/country.
Fangwa et al. 2023,logic_communication,80,70,90,"Paper is clearly structured, arguments coherent, tables/figures informative, and limitations acknowledged. Minor redundancy and length modestly detract."
Fangwa et al. 2023,open_science,45,30,60,Data appendix exists but primary micro-data and code are not publicly posted; no pre-analysis plan; replication would require permissions. Some transparency but not exemplary.
Fangwa et al. 2023,global_relevance,85,75,95,"Findings speak directly to improving maternal/child health in low-income countries, align with SDGs, and inform donors and NGOs globally; high applicability beyond academia."
Haushofer et al. 2020,overall,76,65,85,Arithmetic mean of the six component mid-points ≈76. All dimensions are reasonably balanced; none warrants overweighting relative to the others.
Haushofer et al. 2020,claims_evidence,80,70,90,"Clear questions, large RCT, strong first-order effects on cash arm; nulls for PM+ carefully characterised; multiple robustness, Bayesian checks and demand tests bolster credibility."
Haushofer et al. 2020,methods,85,75,95,"Well-powered four-arm cluster RCT, village and household randomisation, pre-analysis plan, FDR correction, ANCOVA, heterogeneity, spillovers; few design flaws. Implementation fidelity monitored; minor concerns on self-report measures."

Hill et al. 2024,claims_evidence,75,60,90,"Main questions explicit; evidence drawn from millions of papers/patents yields high statistical power. Relies on citations as impact and observational comparisons, so strength of causal claim is moderate."
Hill et al. 2024,methods,78,65,90,"Cosine-similarity pivot metric is sensible and validated with robustness checks; stratifications and quasi-natural experiments (COVID, retractions) improve credibility. Still susceptible to unobserved confounding and self-selection."
Hill et al. 2024,advancing_knowledge,70,50,85,Introduces widely applicable measurement framework and documents trend of growing specialization. Valuable but incremental relative to broader literature on scientific mobility and novelty.
Hill et al. 2024,logic_communication,85,70,95,Narrative is well structured; assumptions and definitions explicit; figures intuitive; reasoning easy to follow and conclusions proportionate to evidence.
Hill et al. 2024,open_science,60,40,80,"Uses largely public data sources; paper indicates supplementary materials. However, code and processed datasets are not clearly released, limiting full reproducibility."
Hill et al. 2024,global_relevance,65,45,80,"Findings inform science-policy decisions on specialization vs. exploration and crisis responsiveness, but implications for broader global priority interventions are indirect."

Jack et al. 2022,logic_communication,85,75,95,"Argumentation is transparent, assumptions discussed, writing lucid, tables and figures supportive; minor complexity in remote-sensing appendix only weakly affects clarity."
Jack et al. 2022,open_science,60,40,75,"Trial is registered and design materials shared, but code, data, and full remote-sensing model are not yet publicly archived; replication would require significant effort."
Jack et al. 2022,global_relevance,88,75,95,"Addresses severe air-pollution externality affecting hundreds of millions, offers scalable, low-cost mitigation insights; high salience for policymakers in LMICs and climate-health agendas."
Kremer et al. 2020,overall,61,53,70,"Arithmetic mean of six component mid-scores (60,45,55,80,40,85≈61). No single dimension clearly dominates decision-relevance enough to justify overriding the mean."
Kremer et al. 2020,claims_evidence,60,45,70,"Main claims (AMC logic, performance, design trade-offs) are stated clearly and backed by the best publicly available descriptive statistics and prior modelling, but evidence base is thin and largely secondary owing to 5-page format."
Kremer et al. 2020,methods,45,30,60,"Paper contains no new empirical identification or detailed modelling; relies on previously published theory and descriptive comparisons. Reasoning is appropriate, but methodological contribution is modest."
Kremer et al. 2020,advancing_knowledge,55,40,70,"Synthesis of theory and first-decade experience is useful, especially for policy design, yet incremental relative to earlier AMC literature; limited novelty lowers percentile."

Kremer et al. 2020,open_science,40,25,60,"No new dataset or code released; relies on publicly available GAVI/WHO figures but underlying calculations not replicated. Transparency adequate for overview, but below field’s emerging norms."
Kremer et al. 2020,global_relevance,85,75,95,Focus on vaccine access and design of pull incentives directly addresses high-priority global health challenges; clear practical implications for donors and LMIC policymakers.
Kremer et al. 2022,overall,84,70,92,"Strong methods, credible evidence, clear exposition and very high practical relevance yield a high composite score. Open-science practices somewhat lag the rest, so arithmetic mean (≈84) is appropriate."
Kremer et al. 2022,claims_evidence,80,65,90,Main questions are explicit; authors marshal the best available RCT data and run extensive robustness checks. Some uncertainty remains about residual publication bias and representativeness of the 18 studies.
Kremer et al. 2022,methods,85,70,95,"Systematic search, preregistration, careful risk-of-bias appraisal, appropriate rare-event meta-analytic models, sensitivity analyses and Bayesian predictive framing. Minor concerns: heterogeneity not fully explained; mortality duration harmonisation."
Kremer et al. 2022,advancing_knowledge,90,70,97,"Provides first quantitatively persuasive estimate of water-chlorination effect on child mortality and links it to cost-effectiveness, likely to shift funding and research agendas."
Kremer et al. 2022,logic_communication,85,70,93,"Narrative is clear, assumptions explicit, figures/tables readable, limitations candidly discussed. A long manuscript but argument flow remains easy to follow."
Kremer et al. 2022,open_science,70,50,85,Study preregistered; many underlying data obtained from authors. Paper promises code and replication files but not all primary mortality data are shareable; some author correspondence data remain closed.
Kremer et al. 2022,global_relevance,95,80,99,"Addresses major global health burden (unsafe water), demonstrates highly cost-effective interventions and analyses delivery models suited to LMICs; findings directly actionable for donors and governments."
Kubo et al. 2023,overall,67,55,80,"Across six criteria the study scores solidly above the median but is not field-leading. Strengths are rigorous SDID implementation, clear exposition, and a novel, policy-relevant question; weaknesses are limited external validity, partial species identification, and only moderate openness. Simple average of sub-scores (≈67) seems appropriate."
Kubo et al. 2023,claims_evidence,70,55,80,"Research questions and headline claim are crisply stated; evidence from a decade of auction data is substantial and causally oriented. Still, inference on true demand and substitution is indirect and relies on assumptions about species equivalence, so confidence is tempered."
Kubo et al. 2023,methods,75,60,85,"Use of SDID with seasonality controls, placebo and sensitivity checks is cutting-edge for conservation policy work. Data scraping and NLP identification are competently executed. Caveats: single online platform, potential misclassification of substitutes, and partial treatment of parallel-trend plausibility."
Kubo et al. 2023,advancing_knowledge,65,50,75,"Provides one of the first causal estimates of spillovers from wildlife trade bans, highlighting an overlooked risk and offering concrete policy discussion.

Kubo et al. 2023,global_relevance,60,45,75,"Illegal wildlife trade is a global priority, and findings on spillover risks are broadly instructive. However, study focuses on three Japanese taxa and one auction site; direct applicability to other regions, higher-value taxa, or policy contexts is uncertain."
Liang et al. 2021,overall,78,65,88,Novel large-scale biodiversity–economy coupling study with credible causal design and channel analysis; some external‐validity and sample‐representativeness limits keep it below very top tier.
Liang et al. 2021,claims_evidence,85,70,93,"Clearly stated questions, rich descriptive patterns, multiple quasi-experimental strategies; conclusions mostly stay within evidence, minor extrapolation caveats."

Schuett et al. 2023,overall,67,50,80,"Solid descriptive work, good transparency and communication, but limited methodological strength and novelty keep it shy of the top quartile. Mean of component scores (≈67) is appropriate; no single metric is overwhelmingly decision-relevant."
Schuett et al. 2023,claims_evidence,65,45,80,Main claims (broad expert support for 50 practices) are clear and closely tied to survey outputs. Evidence is appropriate but modest in scope; potential non-response and selection bias acknowledged but not resolved.
Schuett et al. 2023,methods,55,35,75,"Standard expert‐survey methods, preregistration, basic stats. Strengths: high response rate, clear analytic plan. Weaknesses: purposive sample, small N for subgroup tests, limited robustness checks. Competent but not exemplary."

Trammel and Aschenbrenner 2025,overall,75,65,85,Rough mean of component scores (~73) but nudged upward because advancing-knowledge and global-relevance are particularly decision-salient for funders and policymakers considering x-risk. Quality is strong but not in very top decile due to limited openness and stylised methods.
