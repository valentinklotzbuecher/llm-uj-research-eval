2312.14289v2,overall,67,50,82,"Averaging component scores (≈67) seems appropriate; no single metric dominates decision-relevance. Strengths in logic, novelty, and global importance offset weaker open-science practices."
2312.14289v2,claims_evidence,60,40,78,Main claims are explicit and linked to quantitative estimates. Evidence base mixes empirical literature with elicited forecasts; large reliance on uncertain expert judgment lowers strength.
2312.14289v2,methods,65,45,80,"Economic-utility model is standard and sensitivity analyses are extensive. Yet many parameters lack external validation and some structural assumptions are contestable, limiting robustness."
2312.14289v2,advancing_knowledge,70,50,85,"Integrates growth economics with bio-risk modeling, offering novel quantitative framing for ‘time of perils’. Provides decision-relevant numbers that few prior papers supply."
2312.14289v2,logic_communication,75,60,88,"Report is well-structured, transparent about assumptions, and walks readers through quantitative consequences clearly. Minor complexity and jargon may hinder non-experts."
2312.14289v2,open_science,50,25,70,"Narrative mentions Python code but public repo, full data, and replication package are not yet evident. Documentation of parameter sources is decent but not fully reproducible."
2312.14289v2,global_relevance,80,60,93,"Directly addresses existential bio-risk, technology policy, and resource allocation for science—issues central to global priorities. Outputs are framed for policymakers and funders."
ssrn-4071953,overall,84,70,92,"Strong methodology, large potential impact, clear exposition; minor reservations on publication-bias risk and data openness keep it below top decile."
ssrn-4071953,claims_evidence,80,65,90,"Main claims stated clearly; evidence from 18 RCTs with extensive sensitivity checks supports them, but residual concerns about unobserved bias and heterogeneity remain."
ssrn-4071953,methods,85,70,93,"Systematic search, preregistered, appropriate Bayesian & frequentist random-effects, multiple robustness tests; minor limitations on age-specific modeling and reliance on author-supplied data."
ssrn-4071953,advancing_knowledge,85,68,93,"Provides first credible pooled mortality estimate for water treatment and links it to cost-effectiveness, likely to influence funding and research priorities."
ssrn-4071953,logic_communication,90,78,97,"Narrative is well-structured, assumptions explicit, figures/tables clear; arguments easy to follow."
ssrn-4071953,open_science,70,50,85,"Pre-analysis plan registered; code made available; but some underlying mortality data cannot be shared and requires author permission, limiting full reproducibility."
ssrn-4071953,global_relevance,92,80,98,"Addresses major global health burden, provides actionable cost-effectiveness numbers useful for LMIC policymakers and donors."
w23928,overall,70,60,80,"Solid, frequently cited theoretical contribution; above-average modelling rigour and communication but limited empirical evidence or open-science practices temper its standing."
w23928,claims_evidence,65,50,75,"Main claims are clearly stated and internally supported by formal models, yet empirical corroboration is light and several conjectures remain speculative."
w23928,methods,70,55,80,"Applies standard growth-theory tools creatively (task-based models, Baumol effects). Assumptions are transparent; robustness is discussed, but no empirical/quantitative validation or formal proofs of all assertions."
w23928,advancing_knowledge,80,65,90,"Frames AI within growth economics, spurring large subsequent literature; introduces novel synthesis (automation + Baumol) and agenda-setting questions."
w23928,logic_communication,85,75,95,"Argumentation is clear, stepwise, well referenced; mathematical logic largely sound; writing accessible to economists and policymakers."
w23928,open_science,40,20,55,"Working paper is freely available, but no code, data, replication files; models not packaged in computational notebooks; no preregistration (theoretical work)."
w23928,global_relevance,75,60,85,"Addresses AI’s impact on world growth, inequality, convergence—central to global policy debates; insights mostly conceptual, with limited direct policy guidance or quantification."
w30539,overall,84,75,92,"Large-scale, well-designed RCT with clear effects and policy relevance. Methods and exposition are first-rate; open-science practices less outstanding. Averaging component scores (≈84) reflects balanced quality across dimensions."
w30539,claims_evidence,90,80,96,"Key questions are explicit; causal claims tightly linked to randomized design; extensive robustness and heterogeneity checks. Minor risk of overstating general-equilibrium spillovers, but generally careful."
w30539,methods,92,85,97,"Nationwide cluster-randomized design, preregistration, large N, appropriate inference (two-way clustering, province-day FE), mechanistic tests, falsification checks. Remaining concerns: limited follow-up horizon and some self-reported outcome measures."
w30539,advancing_knowledge,85,70,93,"First experimental evidence on citizen appeals at national scale; bridges political economy, environmental econ, and development. Likely to shape future work on governance and social media. Novelty high though context-specific."
w30539,logic_communication,90,80,95,"Clear motivation, logical flow, transparent assumptions, well-labeled figures/tables; mechanisms and limitations openly discussed. Dense 60-page draft may limit accessibility for some audiences."
w30539,open_science,60,40,75,Pre-registered in AEA RCT registry; data appendix provided. Core CEMS and administrative data not publicly shareable; replication code not yet posted. Documentation adequate but could be fuller.
w30539,global_relevance,85,70,93,Addresses air/water pollution—major global health burden; insights transferable to other LMICs with growing social‐media penetration. Direct policy levers for regulators and NGOs; high potential impact on SDGs.
w33018,overall,83,75,90,"Strong design, execution, and clarity plus high policy relevance place paper in top quintile. Averaging component scores (85,88,80,90,70,85)=83 so default mean accepted."
w33018,claims_evidence,85,75,93,Main questions clearly stated; online + 880k-voter field RCT provide unusually strong causal evidence. Effect sizes and limitations discussed. Some external-validity caveats remain.
w33018,methods,88,78,95,"Pre-registered, large-scale, well-powered RCTs with appropriate IV analysis, balance checks, heterogeneity, robustness. Assumptions reasonable; minor concerns on spillovers and measurement of misperceptions keep from 95+."
w33018,advancing_knowledge,80,65,90,"Adds rare causal evidence that information can shift pro-democracy demand under authoritarianism, informing broader debates. Value high yet context-specific and prior persuasion studies exist."
w33018,logic_communication,90,80,97,Argumentation transparent; figures/tables clear; assumptions explicit; writing accessible despite length. Minor redundancy only.
w33018,open_science,70,50,85,"AEA registry, IRB, and description of materials provided; intent to share instruments & code. Data access may be restricted (administrative voter files, Facebook); replication package not yet public."
w33018,global_relevance,85,70,95,Findings pertain to democratic backsliding—a top global priority; insights useful for practitioners designing pro-democracy interventions in similar contexts.
